## Abstract
Team AquaNova proudly presents **AquaBot X** — an eco-friendly, automated robotic system capable of producing pure water from atmospheric humidity. The robot utilizes a DHT11 Temperature & Humidity sensor to measure ambient temperature and humidity. Based on these readings, a Peltier cooling system is activated, which condenses moisture from the air to produce water.

The collected water is stored in a reservoir monitored by a Water Level Sensor. Real-time data including water level, humidity, and temperature are displayed on a 16x2 LCD module for user convenience. The entire system is controlled by an Arduino UNO microcontroller, designed for automated, low-power operation.

Following the theme **“The Future of Robots,”** AquaBot X represents a smart, humane solution to address future water scarcity challenges. Team AquaNova envisions a sustainable, tech-driven future with this project.

## Problem Statement
Many regions worldwide, especially rural and disaster-prone areas, suffer from a severe shortage of clean drinking water. There is a pressing need for an automatic, portable solution capable of producing water using electricity or solar power.

## Proposed Robotic Solution
Our robot draws water vapor from the air, cools it down, and converts it into liquid water. Key components include:
- **DHT11 Sensor:** Measures ambient temperature and humidity.
- **Water Level Sensor:** Monitors the water volume in the reservoir.
- **Peltier Module:** Facilitates condensation by cooling the air.
- **LCD Display:** Shows real-time sensor data (humidity, temperature, water level).
- **Arduino UNO:** Central controller managing sensor readings and actuator controls.

The cooling plate is made of aluminum for efficient heat transfer, combined with a heatsink and fan for thermal management.
